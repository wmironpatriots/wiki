# Preface to the Learning Course
The learning course is built to allow you to self learn in tandem with offseason presentations. Concepts will be introduced during these meetings that you will reinforce by reading pages in the course and doing the assignments here. Keep in mind that the course is designed to allow everyone to go at their own pace.

While going through these pages, keep these three practices in mind as they will help you learn better:

1. If you don’t understand a concept:
    * Try and ask an expirenced member of the team
    * Try and ask another software member
    * Search it up yourself; Use google or an LLM

2. Do the practice problems and exercise on your own. You want to have an actual understanding of what you learn, searching up answers or getting them from other people should only come out of desperation.


3. If you can’t find someone to help you, you can look it up or try using an LLM (chat gpt or gemini). Keep in mind that LLMs can unreliable.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the learning course is still a work in progress! If you notice any errors or problems throughout the documentation please report it. With that, you are ready to continue.
