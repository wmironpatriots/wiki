# Preface to Section A
Since the majority of the code our team writes is in java, it is important to have familiarity with the language.

In this section we will go over:
* Basic programming in Java (Data types, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.)
* Object Oriented Programming in Java (classes, objects, inhertience, etc.)
* Team style guide

Java can be a confusing language to understand, so if you need help don't feel scared to ask expirenced members of your team!
