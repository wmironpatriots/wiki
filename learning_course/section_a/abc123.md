# Preface to Section A

Since the majority our robot code is written in Java, it is important to have familiarity with the language.

Starting off from the following resources will be a good starting point. You'll be able to pick up concepts and practices by working on more robot code.

## Resources
If you are completely new to programming, or have experience in other languages, you may want to start from one of these resources:

* [Head First Java](https://www.rcsdk12.org/cms/lib/NY01001156/Centricity/Domain/4951/Head_First_Java_Second_Edition.pdf); If you pick this you should only read:
    * Chapters 1-4
    * Chapters 5-6 (you don't need to actually make the game just understand how it works)
    * Chapters 7-8
    * Chapter 10 (ignore the date/calendar stuff at the end)
    * Chapter 11 (Just read the sections about handling exceptions)
* [Code Academy Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)

It's recommended that you pick the book as it's more comprehensive, but remember that you don't actually have to read the entire book before you start doing the exercises in the next section.

**It's important to note that we only want you to gain a familiarity with Java. Don't spend too much time, just get familiar enough with concepts and then move on. You'll have time later on to get the hang of things.**

Java can be a confusing language to understand, so if you need help don't feel scared to ask expirenced members of your team!
